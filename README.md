# Real-time Cryptocurrency Data Analysis using ccxt Library

This code utilizes the ccxt library to access real-time cryptocurrency data and perform technical analysis. Here's a brief summary of how it works:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including ccxt, pandas, pyautogui, asyncio, and ARIMA from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.

2. Define a function called `clique` that simulates a mouse click at a specific location on the screen and types a given text.

3. Define an asynchronous function called `escreve` that simulates user input by clicking at a specific location, typing a given text, and waiting for a certain period of time.

4. Define an asynchronous function called `main` that acts as the main logic of the program.

5. Initialize a Binance exchange object using the ccxt library to connect to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.

6. Enter a while loop to continuously load market data from the exchange and retrieve available symbols.

7. For each symbol, if it contains "BTC" in its name and has a specific amount of data available, fetch the OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the symbol at a specific time interval.

8. Process the fetched data by calculating moving averages and differences between the averages.

9. Based on certain conditions, such as the relationship between moving averages, print the symbol name.

10. Call the `escreve` function to simulate user input, potentially for further actions like trading or analysis.

11. Iterate through different time intervals for data retrieval.

12. Loop back to the beginning if all time intervals have been processed.

Overall, this code leverages the ccxt library to access real-time cryptocurrency data and performs technical analysis on symbols containing "BTC" in their name. It calculates moving averages and analyzes the relationships between them to identify potential trading opportunities. The code also includes functionalities to simulate user input and interact with the system based on the analyzed data.
